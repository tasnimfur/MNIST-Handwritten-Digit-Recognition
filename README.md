# MNIST-Handwritten-Digit-Recognition

Summary 

The objective of this project is to write a program that can recognize and classify handwritten digits with an accuracy greater than the previously achieved 99.15%. To achieve this, a convolutional neural network (CNN) model will be trained and used for this task. The MNIST dataset which contains 70,000 images will be used to train the machine learning model. Each image in the dataset is a grayscale image that has size 28x28 pixels. Initially, the dataset is loaded and stored into a variable. Then it is split into training data and test data. The train samples are used for training the machine learning classification model whereas the test samples are for validation. Furthermore, the performance of the machine learning model will be evaluated by calculating the accuracy score of the CNN model.

Background A convolutional neural network is a machine learning model that consists of several layers. It is very useful for classification and recognition tasks including handwritten digit recognition.

The Challenge 

Since I am not familiar with the OpenCV library and I have only limited exposure to the area of machine learning, it would be challenging to learn all the concepts necessary to complete the project within the limited time that we are given. By doing this project, I am hoping to expand my knowledge on machine learning concepts as well as computer vision. Moreover, my goal is to learn how to apply the machine learning and computer vision concepts to solve real world problems such as the handwritten digit recognition problem.

Goals and Deliverables The following goals must be achieved:

- Train a CNN model that takes an image of a handwritten digit as input and makes a prediction about what digit is written on the image.

- Try different machine learning models and compare accuracy results.

If possible, I hope to achieve the following goal:

- An algorithm that recognizes hand drawn geometric shapes such as a circle or a square. In order to evaluate success, the code will be tested and validated on the test data to measure how accurate the model is in making a prediction.
